# CLI Employee Tracker with Node.js and mySQL
A CLI using node.js, which uses mySQL as the database management system. This is my first time using a database or mySQL.

## Description 
TBD

## Images

## Installation 
Keep all files in a single folder and do not move files around within the folder. You must also have node.js and perform a npm install to bring in all the necessary node modules. Run application using app.js as your node starting point.

## Usage 
This was primarily made to meet the requirements of a homework assignment. If for some reason you really want to use a CLI to manage your team of employees you could do that too.

## Credits 
I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. I have included citations in the form of comments throughout the javascript.

## Contributing 
I was the only one to work on this project, but of course I had help from my instructor, TA's, and classmates.

## Challenges
TBD.
